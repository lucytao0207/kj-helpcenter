# After the song is distributed (1\~3 months later), why there is still no revenue?

The revenue statement of the song will be updated in your account roughly **3\~4 months after** the distribution date.&#x20;

SDISTRO has cooperation and docking with more than 100 streaming media platforms around the world,&#x20;

The report feedback cycle and payment cycle of each issuance channel are different, and the channel will generally feedback the report data of the current month **after 2-3 months**.&#x20;

Once we receive the report of feedback from the platform, the system will automatically update it to your SDISTRO account. Please be patient.
