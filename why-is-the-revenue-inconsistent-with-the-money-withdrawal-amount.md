# Why is the revenue inconsistent with the money withdrawal amount?

The inconsistency between the revenue and the cash withdrawal is due to the fact that SDISTRO has cooperation and docking with more than 100 streaming media platforms around the world, and the payment cycle and payment time of each distribution channel are different. Only after the channel completes the payment, the user can withdraw this part of the proceeds. At the end of each quarter, we will update the revenue based on the actual receipts.
