# After the album is distributed through SDISTRO how is the revenue share calculated?

SDISTRO has no fees to distribute music. SDISTRO will receive a portion of your royalties automatically. Depending on the regions selected SDISTRO will receive between 20%-30% of the royalties generated after distribution will be collected.&#x20;

The specific share ratio can be found within the contract agreement between Kanjian Music and the user.
