# Can I release cover works?

SDISTRO can distribute cover version songs for you. Please do the following:

**1. Obtain the license and authorization certificate of the copyright owner of the original song;**

**2. After obtaining the authorization certificate, contact our legal department (legalaffairs@kanjian.com) to conduct a licensing audit.**

**3. After the audit is passed your cover versions can be distributed through the SDISTRO.**
